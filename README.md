It is a Electric Vehicle Population data.

This data was intended to be used for EDA practise.

Model Creation is not possible in this data for reasons such as High Skewness (Large Number of outliers), Limited Number of Data and low influence of Independent Variables with the Target Variable.

All the necessary EDA operations were performed on this dataset like :

Missing Values Treatment.
Logical Imputation.
Unique Value Analysis.
Feature Engineering.
Null values Removal.
Outliers check.
Numerical and Categorical Split of the data.
Univariate Analysis.
Bivariate Analysis.
Encoding.
Scaling.
Transformation (Didn't add because of High Skewness)

I have Shared the jupyter Notebook file that explains the EDA part as well
